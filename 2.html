<dt><FONT COLOR="BROWN">1.#MODIMANTRA</FONT></DT><dd>The India of tomorrow is looking at empowerment, faster connectivity, more jobs, better education and improved quality of life. The Good Governance model 
of Shri Narendra Modi, enrapturedly  referred to as #ModiMantra encompasses these broad themes into simple takeaways which have the potential of 
transforming India in the near future.

<P><dt><FONT COLOR="BROWN">3.VISION OF MODI</FONT></dt><dd>Shri Narendra Modi has outlined his Vision for the India of tomorrow which resonates with the BJP's philosophy of "Sab Ka Saath, Sab Ka Vikas".
The comprehensive vision laid out by Shri Modi builds on the heritage of India's rich social and cultural diversity, its tradition, the strength of our human resource and the aspirations of the youth and women.
The concept of Brand India encapsulates all the sectors that have the potential to make India a global power. The five-Ts of Brand India are Talent, Trade, Tradition, Tourism and Technology.</dd>


<P><DT><FONT COLOR="BROWN">4.DEVELOPMENT</FONT></DT><DD>When a political party talks of development, it often talks of roads, ports, GDP growth, stock markets, agriculture, exports and international trade, among other issues. To the BJP, however, development is all this and much more. At its core, the BJP’s concept of progress means Indians experiencing change that enables them to fulfil their potential trigger an overall improvement in their daily lives and well-being. With this primary agenda, the party that's armed with an incorruptible and progressive leadership aims to transform and empower the weakest and the most neglected sections of Indian society, without any biases for caste, creed or religion.</DD>


<P><DT><FONT COLOR="BROWN">5.SECURITY</FONT></DT><DD>Security isn’t only what soldiers fight and put their lives at risk for in a distant, forbidding frontier, far from the spotlight; it is also what each one of us, every man and particularly women, experiences while stepping out of home. To the BJP, the concept of security is a dynamic one that has many emerging challenges and opportunities. However, the most important thing for a strong and secure India is a robust economy. No nationalist government at the Centre can avoid paying attention to the Indian economy, as each time we do that we leave India exposed to enemies, both external and internal. High GDP growth and economic development is fundamental to the idea of Indian security.</DD>

<P><DT><FONT COLOR="BROWN">6.GOOD GOVERNANCE</FONT></DT><DD>The BJP’s definition of good governance is a administration where even the weakest and the most vulnerable sections of society have an equal stake in charting the country’s growth. Everything starts and progresses from this single idea. Today, the BJP is the only true merit-based democratic political party in India. In governance, the BJP is committed to the ideals of transparency, efficiency and responsiveness. Time and again, the party has demonstrated its commitment towards these principles, wherever it has been voted to power.</DD>


<P><DT><FONT COLOR="BROWN">7.NATION FIRST</FONT></DT><DD>A firm belief in the ideal that a truly rich and diverse nation like India is optimally united when its people give precedence to their identity as ‘Indians before everything else’ is what led to the birth of the BJP. The party's staunch commitment to this principle is what has ensured its unparalleled rise to becoming one of the largest, most representative political parties in India.</DD>
